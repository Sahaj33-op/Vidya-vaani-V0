## High-Level Architecture

### Microservices Structure
The application follows a microservices architecture with the following key components:

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**: React-based UI with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. **Flask Backend**: Python API server handling RAG, translation, and orchestration
3. **Rasa Server**: NLU engine for intent recognition and dialogue management
4. **Rasa Actions**: Custom action server for complex business logic
5. **Redis**: Session management and caching
6. **NGINX**: Reverse proxy and load balancer

### Data Flow
```
User Input ‚Üí Next.js UI ‚Üí Flask Backend ‚Üí {
  - Language Detection & Translation
  - RAG System (FAISS + SentenceTransformers)
  - Rasa NLU (Intent Recognition)
} ‚Üí Response Processing ‚Üí UI
```

### Key Technical Components

**Translation System** (`translation/`):
- MarianMT for multilingual translation
- Language detection using `franc` and `langdetect`
- Supports English, Hindi, Marathi, and Marwari

**RAG System** (`retriever/`):
- FAISS vector database for document search
- SentenceTransformers for embeddings
- Document chunking and indexing

**Intent Processing**:
- Rasa NLU for intent classification
- Custom actions in `rasa/actions/`
- Domain configuration in `rasa/domain.yml`

### Environment Configuration

Required environment variables (set in `.env.local`):
```bash
KV_REST_API_URL=<redis_connection_url>
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=<redis_auth_token>
UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_URL=<upstash_search_url>
UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_TOKEN=<upstash_search_token>
```

## Deployment

### Development Deployment
Use `docker-compose.dev.yml` for development with hot reload and volume mounting.

### Production Deployment
- **Docker**: Use main `docker-compose.yml` with production settings
- **Kubernetes**: Use `./scripts/deploy.sh` for K8s deployment
- **Monitoring**: Grafana (port 3001) and Prometheus (port 9090) included

### Service Ports
- Next.js: 3000
- Flask Backend: 8000  
- Rasa Server: 5005
- Rasa Actions: 5055
- Redis: 6379
- Grafana: 3001
- Prometheus: 9090

## Language Support

The application processes queries in multiple languages through:
1. **Language Detection**: Automatic detection using script analysis and pattern matching
2. **Translation Pipeline**: MarianMT models for translation to/from English
3. **Intent Recognition**: Rasa processes intents primarily in English
4. **Response Translation**: Final responses translated back to user's language

### Currently Supported Languages
- **English (en)**: Primary processing language with full model support
- **Hindi (hi)**: Complete MarianMT translation support
- **Marathi (mr)**: Complete MarianMT translation support  
- **Marwari (mwr)**: Phrase-mapping fallback to Hindi (partial support)

### Planned Language Additions
- **Gujarati (gu)**: Requires MarianMT model integration
- **Transliteration Support**: For users typing in Roman script

To add new languages:
1. Update `translation/language_detector.py` with new language patterns
2. Add translation models in `translation/translator.py`
3. Update UI language selectors in `components/chat-interface.tsx`
4. Retrain Rasa model with multilingual training data
5. Add language-specific response templates

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | 
|--------|--------|
| Response Time (Cached) | ‚â§ 2s |
| Response Time (Cold) | ‚â§ 5s |
| Intent Accuracy | ‚â• 80% |
| Translation Confidence | ‚â• 70% |
| System Uptime | ‚â• 99.5% |

## Common Troubleshooting

### Redis Connection Issues
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $KV_REST_API_URL
echo $KV_REST_API_TOKEN

# Test Redis connectivity
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping
```

### Rasa Model Issues
```bash
# Retrain model
cd rasa && rasa train

# Check model loading
docker-compose logs rasa-server
```

### Translation Service Issues
```bash
# Check MarianMT model downloads
docker-compose logs flask-backend

# Test translation endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/translate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á", "detect_language": true}'
```

- **Regional Expansion**: 10-50 colleges within state
- **National Scale**: 100+ institutions across multiple states
- **Government Partnership**: State education department integration

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Microservices**: Each major component (translation, RAG, intent) as separate service
- **API-First**: RESTful APIs with clear contracts between services  
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics for all interactions
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching strategy for performance
- **Security**: RBAC, TLS encryption, anonymized logs

### Quality Standards
- **Intent Accuracy**: Maintain >80% accuracy in intent classification
- **Translation Quality**: >70% confidence threshold for auto-translation
- **Response Relevance**: Use source attribution for all document-based responses
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for all service failures
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling across all components

The system serves as a foundation for transforming educational institution communication, with particular focus on inclusive multilingual support for underserved student populations.
